JAMB is a unified tertiary education examination in Nigeria that is written once every year. During its registration, owners of the centers where they are registered are scammed by their workers on different grounds.

This application is meant to help stop or at least minimize the scam rate. It does so by making sure each worker (Registration agents and pin vendors) send in the number of candidates and pins sold to the administrator(owner) at the end of each day's sales. The owner then sees everything on an online dashboard. The dashboard provides at a glance so many processed data from which fraud can be detected.
